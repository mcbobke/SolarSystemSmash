Description
------------------
Two players take control of the Moon and the Sun in a fight to defend the Earth from
comets and hostile planets. The sun is able to move vertically and shoot fireballs
at oncoming enemies, and the moon is able to take a few of the comets into orbit to allow
the sun time to shoot down the others.

Each planet that spawns has an adverse effect on one or both of the players, and the players
must change their playstyle and strategy to defeat the bosses.

How to Play
------------------
The Sun player uses the up and down arrows and the mouse to aim fireballs. Left click to fire.

The Moon player uses WASD to move.
